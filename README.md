# yodausesarch
Custom arch iso for doing stuff like:
- ML/AI
- Blazingly fast rust stuff
- Database stuff
- Art stuff
- Android stuff

This iso is focused on tools I need for my workflow that aren't present in a single easy-to-install distro:

- cuda 
- cudnn
- nvidia drivers
- miniconda
- i3/qtile with polybar
- neovim
- fish + starship shell
- btrfs + zstd compression
- snapper with automated backups before updates or just on regular intervals (gui)
- grub with snapper integrated
- linux-zen kernel
- calamaeres installer for the above

Optional apps:
- Cargo
- postgres, mongodb
- android-studio
- krita
- alacritty
- qutebrowser, brave
- discord, matrix

More to come/be pushed into optional as I feel/don't feel the need for them
